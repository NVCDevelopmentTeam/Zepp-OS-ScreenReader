# Zepp OS Screen Reader Website

This is the official website repository of the Zepp OS Screen Reader (ZSR). The website is built using Svelte, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a Project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already created a project. Great job!

To create a new project, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# To create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# To create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# Or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your website:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> Note: To deploy your website, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

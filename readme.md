## Recommended Zepp OS Version

To ensure the best experience with Zepp OS Screen Reader, we recommend using watch models running Zepp OS 3.5 or higher. These newer versions integrate OpenAI's GPT-4o technology and Zepp Flowâ„¢, providing advanced text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities for a smoother and more natural user experience.
